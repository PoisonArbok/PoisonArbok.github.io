      <p class="ZEE">Zero Escape is a trilogy of videogames released between 2009 and 2017, written and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi. The games (Zero Escape: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors [999]; Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward [VLR]; Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma [ZTD]) have been released for multiple platforms including the DS, 3DS, PS Vita, PC, PS4 and iOS and has been developed by Spike Chunsoft who are notable for also developing the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, Danganronpa and Dragon Quest series. All of the three games in the series are considered to be visual novels with similar gameplay. The large portion of game play is based on the escape room concept wherein a group of characters become locked in a room and must solve a series of puzzles to escape, however this is arguably not the most important part of the games as they are all highly plot driven with an emphasis on decision making and split pathways. In this essay I intend to show why I believe that the Zero Escape series of games are fantastic and should be played.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">The plot line of the Zero Escape series is fundamental to its experience on the player. The plot, while reasonably complex, is explained throughout the series cleverly in such a way that a new player would be able to understand everything they would need to in order to play the game in the series even if they had not played any of the prior games. This helps to make the trilogy accessible to new players and keeps returning players coming back.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">Primarily, the games plot focuses on the idea of the morphogenetic field theory being applied to human brains, allowing memories and information to be shared between timelines (points of decision where opposite paths are taken). Later this idea is expanded to include SHIFTing in which the morphogenetic field is used to transport a consciousness either through time or to a different timeline. Due to the games nature as one where the player makes decisions and can see one timeline play out before remaking the choice to take the other choices, this is an excellent way to justify the players ability to know things they may not supposed to. This is best utilised in 999 where in order to get the true ending of the game, the player must obtain the ‘Zero Lost/Safe’ ending where the player character learns a hidden functionality on the bracelet they are wearing that will enable the to progress in the true ending with that information being sent over the morphogenetic field. Another example of this can be found in VLR when at the end of certain endings bomb codes are given that the player will have to remember, so that they can use those bomb codes to disarm bombs in the true ending with the morphogenetic field being used as the explanation as to why the player character knows all of the codes. It is a clever explanation that competently explains a flaw in many split path visual novels and is well utilised throughout the series.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">Uchikoshi uses similar archetypal characters throughout the game series in order to keep consistency but to also create a sense of familiarity and progression in the series. The majority of the characters in the series can be grouped together in some way or are the exact same character. Normally, this would detract from the game series, however, this actually works in the favour of Zero Escape. This is because by having similar archetypal characters involved in a series full of twists, it may make players incorrectly predict where and who a turn will involve by using the archetypal characters to lead their decision making to allow for better surprises in the long run. An example of this can be seen in VLR where the character Clover appears recognisably similar (and is quickly confirmed to be the same as) Clover from the previous game (999). This is used as a diversion because the game itself is set over forty years in the future. The familiarity of Clover to returning players helps lead players into the belief that the game takes place in 2028 rather than 2074.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">The locations used within the game consistently create the perfect unsettling atmosphere for the games to take place. Given that the main plot of all three games in the trilogy is very dark in tone, the locations where the game take place mirror this aptly. 999 takes place on the HMHS Britannic (referred to in the game incorrectly by the reportedly unused name Gigantic) a sister ship of the Titanic, which is sinking, giving the characters only nine hours to escape. VLR on the other hand takes place on a moon base (which the characters do not know that is a moon base) which has the appearance of a modular metal building without access to natural light. ZTD takes place in an underground bomb shelter, with a distinctly almost homelike feel that is just off enough to feel unsettling. These settings all brilliantly contribute to the bloody and dark themes presented in the game by being cold and foreign at a time where a homelike environment would have been preferred.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">The trilogy of games are well linked by an overarching story which you see play out over the three games. The first game (999) sets the overall tone of the series with you saving one of the fundamental characters (Akane) from dying in an event in the past by solving the same problem in the present. The second game (VLR) then lays out the idea of the world being ravaged by a pandemic that unlike the current pandemic the world is facing, kills 75% of the population and leads to an unruly world with the main character and a supporting character sent to the past by Akane to stop this from happening. ZTD (the final game) is set soon after the first game and is about stopping the release of the virus that would kill lots of the population. Taking an alternate (required) ending in this game leads to the events in VLR taking place, expertly linking the games in the timeline. Doing this leads to the trilogy feeling suitably interconnected and related such that playing through the game in order of release is gratifying to the player (especially as you feel your choices are what lead to that end) and creates an unparalleled experience in visual novels.</p>
      <p class="ZEE">To conclude, the Zero Escape series is very well made and full of clever design and plot choices to create an enjoyable experience every time it is played with its use of character, plot, location and overarching story in order to create a game series I am more than happy to call my favourite.</p>
