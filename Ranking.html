      <h1 style="color: #000000;"><u>RANKED: Mario characters based on how well I think they could cook.</u></h1>
      <p style="margin: auto; width: 45%;">Here I have ranked a large number (20) of Mario characters from worst to best based on how well I think they could cook. This is <b>OBJECTIVE</b> and factual and is in no ways <i>subjective</i>.</p>

          <td>Considering that Spike's main form of attack is to spit a spiked ball or rod from his mouth and to throw it, its taste buds will likely be accustomed to metal. Whatever food that it cooks
          will likely also taste of this. Yuck.</td>

          <td>Daisy just won't have time to cook. She's no housewife, she's got a kingdom to run, horses to ride, tennis to play, footballs to kick, and baseballs to catch. There is no time for proper cooking, but simple tasteless meals may be doable </td>

          certain tasks being impossible, his pure dedication to the art form despite that is worth something.</td>

          <td>Wario is known for a love of garlic, a food which is certainly great in moderation, and his state of being overweight shows that his food is certainly edible. But his food will have a surplus
          of garlic in it to the point of being overpowering. Maybe if he learns to use other flavours, he will rank higher in the future.</td>

          <td style="font-size: 325%;">9</td>
          <td>With Daisy without the time to cook, and needing food, Luigi will likely have to cook some very hearty meals for the overactive princess. And even sometimes Mario, as he'd do anything for his big bro.</td>

          <td style="font-size: 325%;">8</td>
          <td>Given Diddy Kongs propensity to fire peanuts out of a gun, I'd argue that he would likely use that complex ingredient when cooking, and is therefore likely to be a good cook.</td>

          <td style="font-size: 325%;">6</td>
          <td>A clear man of the arts, Waluigi could do no wrong in the eyes of the internet. And I side with the internet, but only to an extent as I reckon he's a great cook, but that there is several better in and around the mushroom kingdom.</td>

          <td style="font-size: 325%;">3</td>
          <td>Being undead may mean that he has no need to eat food, being immortal presents another problem to Dry Bones, boredom. And what better activity to learn that cooking given that they are often
          surrounded by lava, which could only add to the complex flavours this bone koopa could create.</td>

          <td>Lets face the facts, bowser has got kids to feed. And he learnt to cook from one of the top ranked cooks on the list and consistently kidnaps another. If he isn't good at cooking, there is a problem.
          Being able to breathe the fire to cook with also allows for BBQ style cooking anywhere. Either way Bowser is still a nutorious glutton with a love of roasted meats, so whats to say that he isn't the one cooking them.</td>

          <td>Considering that Peach is renouned for her cakes, it isn't much of a leap in logic to assume that she can likely cook well too given all the extra time and patience she has. Cooking would likely come naturally to the princess.</td>
