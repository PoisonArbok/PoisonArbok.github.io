      <h1 style="color: #d6d6d6;"><u>A compresnsive list of arguments against the ideas of Chair Appreciation</u></h1>
      <p class="white">Here is a compresnsive list of arguments against the frankly wrong and authoritarian idea of "Chair Appreciation".</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="white">
          <h4 class="white" style="text-align: center;">It's creator is someone I don't trust to appreciate anything</h4>
          <img src="images/lew2.png" alt="A Picture of the man behind Chair Appreciation" style="width: 170px; length: 275px;">
          <p class="white">Look here at this man. Has this man done anything of value in his life. I'd argue no. I mean look at him. He <i>could</i> amount to something,
            maybe he has talent. But now? He's clearly off his rocker. Chairs should <b>not</b> be apreciated!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="white">
          <h4 class="white" style="text-align: center;">Some chairs... are <u><i>bad</i></u></h4>
          <p class="white">Chairs should have <u>four legs</u> and should be used only for proper chair like purposes. But in fact, chairs are being made without these simple rules being obliged!</p>
          <img src="images/chair1.jpg" alt="Chair 1" style="width: 250px; length: 250px; float: right;"><img src="images/chair2.jpg" alt="Chair 2" style="width: 250px; length: 250px; float: left;"><img src="images/chair3.jpg" alt="Chair 3" style="width: 250px; length: 250px; display: block; margin: auto;">
          <p class="white">Look at these chairs. Look at 'em. only <b>1</b> has <u>four legs</u>. That is a terrible fraction. One of them has a tounge, a <i>tounge!</i>. That is not a good chair. And one bad apple spoils the batch.
          and here are <b>3</b> bad apples. Not good, and definitely not worth appreciation.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="white">
          <h4 class="white" style="text-align: center;">Other points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="white">Some chairs can be stood on, very dangerous.</li>
            <li class="white">Chairs allow for manspreading.</li>
            <li class="white">I reckon that some real bad people sat on chairs</li>
            <li class="white">Uhhh... sitting down is less productive than standing and therefore the tools that enable you to to be lazy are awful and what is a chair if not a tool for sitting.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
